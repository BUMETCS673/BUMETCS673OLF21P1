Our application, Cheffy, is intended to recommend recipies to people who have leftover 
ingredients in their fridge, or pantry, but don't know what to do with them. 
When given a list of available ingredients, and their quantities, the 
application will make a recipe suggestion that uses some or all of the ingredients. 

Our application can also maintain an inventory of available ingredients based on
past entries, and will notify the user when certain ingredients are expiring.
A user will be able to notify the application if they enjoyed the recipe or not
and future recommendations will be enhanced by the feedback.
