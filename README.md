# Cheffy

- Cheffy is an application that is designed to help users utilize leftover ingredients from their fridge or pantry. When provided with a list of ingredients and a possible selection of dietary restrictions, this application will recommend recipes using some or all of the provided ingredients. The user can choose if the returned recipe must contain all of the ingredients or not). This app aims to help user find uses for ingredients that might otherwise go into the trash and to help minimize food waste.

- Cheffy will also allow the user to maintain a digital "pantry" of the ingredients that they have on hand. Items can be added to or removed from this pantry to match what is available to the user in real life. The user can use choose to add the contents of their pantry to any recipe search. 

- Users will also be able to save recipes to a favorites list. If they encounter a recipe that they either like or want to try later, this gives them a means to keep track of them. This feature, along with the pantry feature, will be accessible to a logged in user.

- Finally, If a user comes across a recipe that interests them, there is a find similar function that will allow the user to see recipes that share common traits to the one they are currently looking at.
