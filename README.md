# Cheffy

- Our application, Cheffy, is intended to recommend recipies to people who have leftover  
ingredients in their fridge, or pantry, but don't know what to do with them. 
When given a list of available ingredients, and their quantities, the 
application will make a recipe suggestion that uses some or all of the ingredients. 

- Our application can also maintain an inventory of available ingredients based on
past entries, and will notify the user when certain ingredients are expiring.
A user will be able to notify the application if they enjoyed the recipe or not
and future recommendations will be enhanced by the feedback. 

- In addition to recommending recipes, a user can search the database for recipes
based on specific ingredients that they would like their recipe to contain. Recipes
of interest will be savable to the user's profile, and a personal pantry will be
accessible to the user (this is where they are able to catalogue their at-home
ingredients).

- Cheffy will also store recipes that the user indicated they've enjoyed. These will
be used to recommend similar, but novel, recipes on the user's homepage when they
login to Cheffy.
